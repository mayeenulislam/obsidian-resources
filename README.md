# Obsidian Resources

Obsidian is a popular Note-taking app that I used everyday. This repository is a collection of Obsidian resources that I felt to share with everybody. I collected some of them from various resources. I put the source information where possible. Beside them most of the resources I made myself and prepared from my own experience and taste.

ðŸ’¡ All the files are best viewed in Obsidian.
